 mplrc is a python module which provides an easy way to change
 matplotlib's plotting configuration for specific publications. 
 
 once installed, you can apply the matplotlib configuration 
 like  so

import mplrc.ieee.transaction


then all plots after this line will follow the conventions defined by 
ieee.transactions. if there is no module matching your publication
and you make one, please submit it to us!
