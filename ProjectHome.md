mplrc is a python module which provides an easy way to change matplotlib's plotting configuration for specific publications.



> you can apply the specific configuration for IEEE transactions like  so
```
import mplrc.ieee.transaction
```

then all plots after this line will follow the conventions defined by
ieee.transactions. if there is no module matching your publication
and you make one, please submit it to us!
